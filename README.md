## 3.5Chan - A Messageboard web app

### Description: <br>
3.5Chan is Messageboard web app that allows users to anonymously create and view discussions.

This is built on react along with JavaScript, HTML, CSS and ChakraUI. 

[GitHub](https://github.com/momonepal/Messageboard)   |    Deployed at [https://not3dot5chan.herokuapp.com/](https://not3dot5chan.herokuapp.com/)

## How it works
* You can see the posts made by the users in the landing page
* The user can hide posts that they do not wish to see
* The user can create a post by clicking on "Create a post" button and then selecting a username and typing their post and hitting submit.
* Tried making users anonymous and allowing them to select a unique id/username every time they create a post without having to sign-in
